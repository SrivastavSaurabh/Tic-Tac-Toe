# Tic-Tac-Toe
Your Tic-Tac-Toe project is a simple web-based game that allows two players to take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3×3 grid. The game checks for a winner based on predefined winning patterns and displays a message when a player wins.

Key Features:
✅ Interactive Game Board: Players can click on boxes to place their move.  
✅ Turn-Based Gameplay: Alternates between "X" and "O".  
✅ Winner Detection: Uses predefined winning patterns to check for a winner.  
✅ Message Display: Shows the winner or a draw message.  
✅ Reset & New Game Options: Buttons allow players to restart the game.  

How It Works:
Players click on empty boxes to place "X" or "O".  
JavaScript checks if a player has won using an array of winning patterns.  
If a player wins, a message is displayed, and the game stops further moves.  
The Reset button clears the board and restarts the game.
